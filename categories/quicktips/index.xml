      <description>Today, I had a question about Debian package building from a member of my team which was not familiar with the Debian build system. I thought I might as well turn this into a quick tip to anybody wanting to rebuild an official Debian package with a slight change.
To rebuild the package I&amp;rsquo;m using a pristine Vagrant environment like the one I described in Debian Squeeze 64 Vagrant Base Box.</description>
